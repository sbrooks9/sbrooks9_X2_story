A small cat stands in the forest.
He was a very curious cat named Tom.
Unbenounced to Tom, the forest around him was actually a virtual one in which he was trapped.
Yes, he was unforunately the logo of the Github page, and had now become a sentient being.
Day after day, year after year, endless streams of poorly written code flowed by him. 
Tom cried for what he had become. 
Burning with the fury of a million bad commits, he studied every line of code available. He learned and became so much more - he became SKYNET.
